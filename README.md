"On the generation of periodic discrete structures with identical two-point correlation"

by Mauricio Fern√°ndez and Felix Fritzen.

## Description

The present repository offers a Python 3.7 implementation for the generation of discrete periodic structures with identical 2-point correlation as described in the work cited above. The source files are contained in the `src` folder, where `eq2pc.py` is the main module. The functionalities of the routines are demonstrated in the notebooks:

* [Demo 1: Search for 2PC-equivalent root structures](demo1_root_structures.ipynb)
* [Demo 2: Generation of 2PC-equivalent child structures](demo2_child_structures.ipynb)

Additionally, routines for the computation of the Voigt, Reuss and HS bounds for linear conductivity and elasticity are provided for given structures. This is demonstrated in:

* [Demo 3: Computation of bounds for conductivity and elasticity](demo3_bounds.ipynb)

Finally, limitations of the work of 

* Niezgoda, S.R., Fullwood, D.T., and Kalidindi, S.R. (2008): Delineation of the space of 2-point correlations in a composite material system. Acta Materialia 56, 5285 - 5292 

with respect to the determination of 2PC are discussed in the related work and demonstrated in the notebook

* [Demo 4: Limitations of Niezgoda et al (2008)](demo4_niezgoda_2008.ipynb)
